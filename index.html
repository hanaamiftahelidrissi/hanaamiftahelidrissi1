	<p> As you conquer the obstacles of figuring out how to use public transit in a foreign country, or asking for simple things,you are building a confidence and ability to adapt in foreign situations. I remember moving to a country where I spoke little to none of the language. You realize that you CAN do things, despite the obstacles and suddenly the obstacles seem less obstructive and more like welcomed challenges.</p>

	<p> Seeing the world provides an education that’s absolutely impossible get in school. Travel teaches you economy, politics, history, geography, and sociology in an intense, hands-on way no class will.</p>

	<p> One of the best things about travel is undoubtedly the friendships and connections you make with people from across the globe. You might be surprised at just how close you can come to people within a matter of hours if you’re thrown together by circumstance in a country that is home to neither of you. </p>
